			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Prior to the arrival of european settlers the Calgary area was inhabited by Blackfoot, Blood, Peigan and Tsuu T'ina first nations peoples. The first European settler was John Glenn in 1873. Calgary got it's name from Colonel James McLeod after his home in the scottish highlands. The Canadian Pacific railway arrived in 1883 and allowed pioneers access to the area and was quickly settled. It was officially proclaimed a city in 1884 with a population of 4000.</p>
