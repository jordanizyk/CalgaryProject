			<h3>Climate</h3>
			<p> Calgary has a humid contintental climate. Winters are typically cold with tempuratures regularily dropping below -20C. One unique feature of Calgary winters is that the cold is often broken up for periods of time by warm chinook winds that blow in from the mountains. The summers are warm and dry with average tempurates in the low to mid twenties. The fall season is short and begins in September and lasts until winter sets in around mid-november. The spring in Calgary is typically the most unstable weather of the year with both rain and snowfall occuring in the spring months and tempuratures changing back and forth between warm and cold very quickly.</p>
